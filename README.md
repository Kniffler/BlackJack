# BlackJoe
Excuse the naming, at the time of making this project, when I was 14/15, I thought it was funny.

# Code structure
While the code itself is quite thoroughly commented, I would like to clarify that the ```cardGameTemplate.cpp``` file serves as a template for anyone who would like to use the format I created back then.

A tab size of 4 spaces is recommended while reading

# The comments' attitude
At the time I made this, I had quite a nack for commenting in a rather... strong tone. Please excuse my former self's language in the source code.
