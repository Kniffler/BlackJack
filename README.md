# BlackJack vs Joe
Excuse the naming at the time of making this project, when I was 14/15, I originally called it Blackjoe, as a parody to jack. I have no idea why, but I've removed that now.

# Code structure
While the code itself is quite thoroughly commented, I would like to clarify that the ```cardGameTemplate.cpp``` file serves as a template for anyone who would like to use the format I created back then.

# Features
This code accounts for almost all standard rules of Blackjack. The only unsupported feature at the time is splitting. Since this is an older, and now abandoned, project I do not plan to add this feature in the future either, it is meerely a mark of my former self's inexperience.

# The comments' attitude
At the time I made this, I had quite a nack for commenting in a rather... strong tone. Please excuse my former self's language in the source code.
